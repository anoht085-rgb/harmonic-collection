  Nathalie Handal's Love Letter resonates with fashion photography since 
  both transform material objects into vessels of meaning, intimacy, and imagination.
  In the poem, she wishes to become a shrine, a scarf, or even a soprano's voice—objects.
  Fashion photography works in a similar way: garments are never just garments but cultural signifiers that can embody rituals, histories, and identities.
  A scarf in an image, for example, can be styled to evoke tradition, rebellion, or belonging, extending its meaning beyond its physical function.
  Like the poem, which seeks to reach the heart and remain there, the strongest fashion images transcend surface aesthetics, lingering as emotional and symbolic gestures.
  Both poetry and fashion photography reveal that objects—whether 
  fabric, image, or word—are capable of carrying human longing, re-enchanting the everyday, and creating intimate connections across distance.
